TO DO:
~~- break this script down into smaller functions~~
~~- add logging like the drupal9 install script.~~
~~- modify the script to do a download of drupal 10 instead of depending on a zip file being provided~~
~~- modify the script to use the tar file instead of a zip file (already built in)~~ ignoring this
